# Euclid cosmic shear likelihood
# The current version of the likelihood is by Tim Sprenger
# plus M. Archidiacono, T. Brinckmann, S. Clesse, J. Lesgourgues
# and is described in detail in Sprenger et al. 1801.08331

# This likelihood is based on an earlier Euclid lensing likelihood
# by Audren & Lesgourgues described in Audren et al. 1210.2194

# Specifications updated by S. Clesse to fit with Euclid
# specifications used by the WP6-Forecasts working group
# and IST-Forecasting subgroup on Weak-Lensing. Those
# specifications can be found in the googledoc document
# prepared by the Euclid IST - Splinter Group 2
