# Euclid galaxy clustering likelihood
# The current version of the likelihood is by Tim Sprenger
# plus M. Archidiacono, T. Brinckmann, S. Clesse, J. Lesgourgues
# and is described in detail in Sprenger et al. 1801.08331

# This likelihood is based on an earlier Euclid P(k) likelihood
# by Audren & Lesgourgues described in Audren et al. 1210.2194

# Specifications updated by M. Archidiacono to fit with
# Euclid specifications used by the WP6-Forecasts working
# group and IST-Forecasting subgroup on galaxy clustering.
# Those specifications can be found in the googledoc document
# prepared by the Euclid IST - Splinter Group 3.
